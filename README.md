This repository presents a project focused on the Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) and its role in improving healthcare data exchange during transitions of care. The project begins by examining the limitations of traditional health IT systems, where patient records were manually maintained, fragmented across departments, and prone to delays and errors in billing and insurance claims. It then highlights the shift toward digital solutions like Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and Electronic Medical Records (EMRs), which enable seamless sharing of patient data across providers, labs, and pharmacies. The core of the project centers on C-CDA, a standardized format developed under HL7 standards to facilitate clinical document exchange. It compares C-CDA with other HL7 frameworks such as HL7 V2, V3, CDA, and FHIR, emphasizing C-CDA’s role in ensuring interoperability and improving care coordination. Stakeholder insights from organizations like MDDHS, MiHIN, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and Network OneD underscore the practical challenges and benefits of implementing C-CDA.The presentation outlines the evolution of C-CDA versions—from 1.0 to 2.1—each improving interoperability, regulatory compliance, and support for patient-centered care. It also details the structure of C-CDA documents, which include medical history, allergies, medications, lab results, and discharge summaries.  A real-world scenario illustrates how C-CDA streamlines the transition of care by replacing manual faxing with automated, secure data exchange.Case studies from Sentara Healthcare, Geisinger Health System, and Kaiser Permanente demonstrate measurable improvements in patient outcomes, operational efficiency, and return on investment. The project concludes by affirming C-CDA’s importance in modern healthcare: enhancing interoperability, ensuring continuity of care, improving patient outcomes, supporting regulatory compliance, and safeguarding data integrity.
